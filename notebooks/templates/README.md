Template Notebooks
==================

This directory contains clean, output-free template notebooks you can share with colleagues.

How to use
----------
- Copy a template before you run it: File â†’ Save As... (keep the template pristine in the repo).
- Never commit notebooks that contain large outputs (plots, images, arrays) or secrets.
- If you want to keep running notebooks under version control, consider using `nbstripout` or `git-lfs`.

Purpose
-------
These templates provide a reproducible starting point for experiments without storing execution outputs.
